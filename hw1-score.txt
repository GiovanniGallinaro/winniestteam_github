Score: 2.4

Comment:
"- Why did not you use the real data?
- How does the search work?
- How does the graph work with a real number of authors, papers? Does it still behave properly? Doesn't it risk to become very cluttered?
- No interaction on the  graph
- What is the purpos of the papers and authors table, possibly containing thousands of rows?
- Somehow poor implementation"
